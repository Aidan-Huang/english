[00:00.00]This is the VOA Special English Education Report.
[00:04.99]Current and former students
[00:07.15]from Berklee College of Music in Boston
[00:10.15]recently returned to the United States
[00:13.41]after three weeks in Kenya.
[00:15.87]They were part of a cultural exchange program
[00:19.40]aiming to influence lives through music.
[00:23.38]They taught music,performed and donated instruments
[00:28.50]to a Kenyan community center.
[00:30.83]They also learned about traditional Kenyan music.
[00:35.06]Music is an important part of life in Kenya.
[00:38.80](MUSIC)
[00:46.91]"Growing up, I sang a lot in school.
[00:49.48]And we had competitions and choir
[00:53.45]and music every year."
[00:55.47]Sam Lutomia works for the Berklee College of Music.
[00:59.26]He was born and spent his early years in Kenya.
[01:03.12]"When I moved to the States,
[01:04.83]I get exposed to a higher level of music.
[01:08.26]And I was like,
[01:10.06]'Is there something I can do not
[01:11.26]that I'm in the States?'"
[01:12.77]He helped to create a group called
[01:14.79]Global Youth Groove.
[01:17.05]Its goal is to bring western music to young Kenyans,
[01:20.86]and get them to consider music as a career.
[01:24.26]"I started talking with students
[01:25.90]at Berklee College of Music and faculty members,
[01:28.28]and they all responded positively.
[01:31.33]And we started collecting instruments."
[01:33.31]Thirteen Americans made the trip to Kenya in July.
[01:37.71]They included four high school students
[01:40.86]from the Boston area.
[01:42.82]One of them was Marina Miller.
[01:45.29]"We started out in Nairobi.
[01:46.63]We got a chance to meet with local musicians
[01:48.56]and listen to them play."
[01:50.44]Project coordinator Aaron Colverson says
[01:53.59]the Americans presented a gift
[01:56.17]during a visit to Kakamega in western Kenya.
[02:00.55]"We've gathered like 20 instruments.
[02:03.80]We had some recorders and also an entire drum kit,
[02:07.98]lap tops and recording software."
[02:11.31]Many Kenyans attended the activities
[02:13.61]offered by the group.

[02:21.80]Berklee student David Chapman says
[02:24.51]for some of the Kenyans,
[02:26.69]it was the first time to see
[02:29.54]and touch such instruments.
[02:32.15]"Their music classes would just be
[02:34.56]them reading books about western instruments."
[02:37.05]Aaron Colverson says
[02:38.64]music can give someone a sense of power.
[02:42.17]"When you put music in front of kids,
[02:45.14]it seems that their minds open up.
[02:47.41]Music gives them a chance to express themselves
[02:51.08]through songs and writing the songs."
[02:54.09]The American group also performed
[02:56.20]at a national music festival.
[02:58.66]During the trip, Aaron Colverson says,
[03:02.13]they met with local musicians
[03:04.44]and listened to them play.
[03:06.86]They also learned about
[03:08.79]traditional Kenyan instruments,dances and songs.
[03:13.41]AARON COLVERSON (singing in Swahili):
[03:25.12]"It's pretty music to say nice to meet you,
[03:28.07]in Kenya where there are no worries."
[03:30.08]Trip organizer Sam Lutomia says
[03:32.86]he is happy with the levels of energy
[03:35.43]the exchange program has produced.
[03:37.98]He hopes the trip will take place every year
[03:41.42]and expand to neighboring countries.
[03:44.64]I'm Bob Doughty.
